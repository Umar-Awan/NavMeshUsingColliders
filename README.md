# NavMeshUsingColliders
This script generates box-shaped GameObjects matching all Box Colliders (including triggers and inactive ones) in a Unity scene. It helps visualize collider boundaries for NavMesh baking based on colliders rather than Mesh Renderers. The generated boxes are organized under a parent object for easy management.
